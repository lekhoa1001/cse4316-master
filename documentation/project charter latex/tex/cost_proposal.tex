The major cost expenses will come from any libraries or software needed to complete the application. The software needed is dependent on the requirements of our application. The application will need to be on both Android and iOS devices. We will have one language and one implementation for both devices in order to reduce development time. The language will also depend on the protocols used in connecting with the Smart Shutters. It has not yet been decided how we are going to connect with them since the CSE team in charge of the firmware needs to decide with us if we want to connect the Smart Shutters to a central Hub via Bluetooth and then connect the Hub to our application via network/WiFi connection.
