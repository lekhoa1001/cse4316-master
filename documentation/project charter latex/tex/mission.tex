Smart Shutter is a project in which our team along with EE and embedded development teams are creating the standard shutter can be controlled by a mobile app. The app will work on android phone or an iPhone and it will help to move and position the louvers  in required angle by a user. These shutters are produced to be used in commercial building like hospital , business area or retirement homes. The blinds can be used in small scale too.\newline
Since 3 teams are working collaboratively in this project, EE teams will develop motor controller and control board. Embedded development team and our teams will work in microcontroller firmware, communication protocol and app interface. The first and foremost mission in this project is to meet with all the teams and sponsors and decide what should be done by each team. Since our application team is to develop the app that can connect with the shutter controller device through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth and able to control the shutter through the app. The mission of our team is that the app is simpler and easy to use. We are  trying to make the app where we can scan the shutter via barcode and schedule the time at certain angle at given time and date.
