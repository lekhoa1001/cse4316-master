Upon completion of this prototype application, we expect the following success indicators to be observed on the Smart Shutters implementing our application software. \newline
\begin{itemize}
\item The application will accomplish a full functioning interface without bugs
\item The application will establish a connection to multiple Smart Shutters
\item The application will have a functioning preset timer that adjusts the corresponding shutters at the scheduled time even when the app is closed.
\item The Smart Shutters will finish adjusting within 3 seconds of the action event (pressing an adjustment button) on the application
\end{itemize}
