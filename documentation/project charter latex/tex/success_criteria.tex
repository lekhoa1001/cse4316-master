Upon completion of this prototype application, we expect the following success indicators to be observed on the Smart Shutters implementing our application software. \newline
The application will accomplish a full functioning interface without bugs\newline
The application will establish a connection to multiple Smart Shutters\newline
The application will have a functioning preset timer that adjusts the corresponding shutters at the scheduled time even when the app is closed.\newline
The Smart Shutters will finish adjusting within 3 seconds of the action event (pressing an adjustment button) on the application
