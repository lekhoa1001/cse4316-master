User will have access to controlling the shutters through an app on both iOS and android devices. User can control either all shutters in one or more rooms, or certain shutters in only one room. All rooms may be selected, allowing the entire collection of connected shutters to be controlled at the same time. After user has selected which room they wish to control, an interface showing different boxes with numbers will be shown. Each box corresponds to a specific shutter. There is 5 buttons and a slider in that page. The slider controls the shutter, the higher the pointer is the more open the shutter is. UP button opens the shutter by a certain amount (1 percent). DOWN button closes shutter by a certain amount(-1 percent). OPEN button opens the shutter completely (100 percent). CLOSE button closes the shutter completely (0 percent). Reset button closes the shutter and reopens it to the amount that is saved in memory.
