Wouldn't it be great if you could control the amount of natural light entering your house or complex at the touch of a button on your smartphone? Now, a person will be able to control one specific sun blind in a room, or even all the sun blinds in an entire complex in no time, with little to no effort. This is great for those who have physical difficulties, or simply those who aspire to have a fully automated home.
